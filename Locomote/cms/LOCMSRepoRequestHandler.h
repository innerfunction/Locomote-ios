/**
 * A request handler that serves content from a single Locomote content repository.
 * In a typical setup, a file within a specific repository can be referenced using a content
 * URL in the form:
 *
 *      content://{authority}/{account}/{repo}/{path...}
 *
 * Where 'authority' would be the host name (e.g. locomote.sh); 'account' and 'repo' would
 * specify account and content repo names; and 'path...' would be the path to the required
 * file within the repository.
 * In addition, the request handler provides a number of standard API end points which can
 * be used to access file lists and file meta data. These are:
 *
 * > files.api/
 *      Return a list of all files in the repository. Results can be filtered by supplying
 *      query parameters.
 * > files.api/{id}
 *      Access a file's meta-data by ID.
 * > files.api/{id}/content
 *      Access file content by the file ID.
 * > files.api/{id}/siblings
 *      Return a list of a file's siblings. These are all files that share the same path
 *      directory as the reference file.
 * > files.api/{id}/children
 *      Return a list of the immediate children of a file. These are all files that are
 *      in a path directory immediately below the reference file.
 * > files.api/{id}/descendents
 *      Return a list of all descendents of a file. These are all files that are in a path
 *      directory below the reference file.
 * (TODO: Document fileset.api)
 * > search.api
 *      Perform a full-text search of page content.
