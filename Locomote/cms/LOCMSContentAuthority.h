/**
 * A content authority backed by a Locomote content repository.
 * Depending on the host name used, the authority may be mapped to a single repository or
 * to multiple content repositories. For example, if configured to use the standard
 * Locomote host name (locomote.sh), then the authority may potentially map to any
 * content repo hosted on that domain, and individual repositories are supported by
 * providing an {account}/{repo} or {account}/{repo}/{branch} handler mapping. Alternatively,
 * if a custom domain is used which is mapped to a specific account and repository then
 * the entire authority is mapped to just that repo. The authority's 'setting' property
 * is used to configure the default mapping details.
