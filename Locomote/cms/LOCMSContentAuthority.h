/**
 * A content authority backed by a Locomote content repository.
 * Depending on the host name used, the authority may be mapped to a single repository or
 * to multiple content repositories. For example, if configured to use the standard Locomote
 * host name (locomote.sh), then the authority may potentially map to any content repo hosted
 * on that domain, and individual repositories are supported by providing an {account}/{repo}
 * or {account}/{repo}/{branch} handler mapping. Alternatively, if a custom domain is used which
 * is mapped to a specific account and repository then the entire authority is mapped to that
 * one repo. The authority's 'setting' property is used to configure the default mapping details.
